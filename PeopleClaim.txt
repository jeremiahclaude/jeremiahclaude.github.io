People claim to have open eyes, that they're aware
But they only see what they want, or what's on the news,
Because when the media spoon feeds you, you miss the flares,
You're just ignorant, you're blind, there's no excuse,
Either open your eyes or go back to the day care,
Because you can't read for yourself, you stick to their views,
You're a little kid still playing foursquare,
Tripping over laces, missing all the cues,
Its right in front of you, I swear, 
It's all up to you to keep up with the world news.
Your mind seems like it's elsewhere,
Eyes on the phone while you walk down the avenues,
Updating your status, something about a prayer,
But that's only because Paris is the biggest abuse,
But the lives are gone, it's a nightmare,
And you don't even know where Beirut is, it's not fair
Everyone knows about bombings, because they were in the news,
Keep your eyes open and you might see through the glare,
You might even figure out the genocide wasn't just Jews,
Only a million in Rwanda, and further elsewhere,
But you're caught up in your road trip to Syracuse,
All you care about is your selfie in Times Square,
You're so anti-Islam, because of abuse,
But be it's just the crusades, the same fanfare,
Religious conquest in the name of a God, no need to peruse,
It's pretty clear to see, except this lot don't say the Lord's Prayer
So many parallels you've got to be blind to miss the twos
Stop being so conservative, close minded and get off your lawn chair,
Widen your eyes and horizons, don't judge tattoos,
Because the worst crooks are those with silverware.
Suits on Wall Street, pocket change for air fare,
Only thing on their mind is becoming a billionaire
People in this country pay taxes supposedly for healthcare,
While kids are dying from missiles on cruise,
Everyone here makes me sick, ranting everywhere,
All about their struggles and interviews 
People get ready for their day with great care,
Claiming to have made big breakthroughs, 
But in the end it's all the same, still unaware,
Of the people that die over political issues.
